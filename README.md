### Hello there! üëã

I‚Äôm Ankit, a researcher with a diverse background in computational biology, quantitative modeling, machine learning, and data analysis. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

üß™ Current Role
At CatalYm, I focus on the intersection of spatial omics, and immuno-oncology to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive therapeutic resistance and immune evasion in the TME. My work integrates running different spatial-omics tools to accelerate discovery and guide translational decisions.


üß¨ Previous work (2021-2025) @ University of W√ºrzburg, Germany
I developed NiCo, a computational pipeline that integrates scRNA-seq with image-based spatial transcriptomics to reveal cell-cell communication and gene program (meta-program) covariation within tissue niches. We applied NiCo to diverse biological contexts including liver, brain, and developmental tissues to uncover novel mechanistic insights.

ü¶¥ Past Endeavors (2018-2020) @ Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel

I explored the fascinating realm of bone growth morphogenesis. Using quantitative modeling, statistical analyses, and morphometric techniques applied to growth plate tissue images, we uncovered mechanism governing long bone elongation. Some highlights are: Cell/Nuclei segmentation and registration of bones, Identification of isometric growth of chondrocytes in the resting zone vs. allometric growth in the proliferative zone. Discovery of distinct cell lineage cluster patterns between embryonic and neonatal mice bones contributing to growth directionality

### üî¨ Research Highlights (2013‚Äì2018)

Earlier in my research career, I worked at the intersection of molecular biology, genomics, and computational modeling. Key projects included:

- üß¨ **Chromosome Positioning & Nuclear Architecture**  
  Developed **biophysical models** to predict **chromatin distribution** and **chromosome positioning** along the radial nuclear axis using gene expression data as a proxy. Explored **2D/3D chromosome structures** to understand spatial organization within nuclei.

- üß™ **Gene Regulation & ChIP-seq Analysis**  
  Analyzed **ChIP-seq datasets** to identify motif mixtures using clustering based on **sequence similarity** and **position-based features**, helping to characterize regulatory element patterns.

These foundational projects strengthened my skills in statistical modeling, data integration, and the use of genomic signals to inform structural and regulatory insights in cellular systems.


I've explored various facets of biology and data analysis throughout my career. This includes using gene expression as a proxy for activity to elucidate chromosome positioning in nuclei. I developed biophysical models to predict chromatin distributions in nuclei along the radial direction, even delving into their 2D/3D chromosome shapes. My journey has also taken me into the realm of ChIP-seq data analysis to uncover mixtures of motifs based on clustering using sequence similarity and position weight matrix models.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills:

Throughout my research journey, I've acquired a versatile skill set spanning machine learning, molecular dynamics simulation, quantitative and statistical data modeling, image analysis, spatial biology, spatial transcriptomics, scRNA-seq, cellular neighborhood analysis, and the quantification of cell/nuclei morphological properties (volume, surface area, sphericity, principal component orientation, and many more).
