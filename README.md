### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on a machine learning-based pipeline to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing data and image-based spatial transcriptomics data. With this data integration, we learned how the cell type-cell type interaction formed in the niche and how gene covariation occurs between interacted cell types. We have applied this method to the publically available liver, organogenesis, brain, and intestine data. This method could be beneficial for the community to find a novel therapeutic drug target candidate. (MS and packages under preparation)


Prior to this, I was involved in a project explaining how the long bone (tibia, ulna) elongates. We have described some novel facts about the bone growth mechanism with quantitative modeling, statistical analysis, and various morphometric analysis of cells and nuclei in growth plate (GP) tissue images. We have segmented the cells/nuclei, registered the different bones, and calculated the morphological properites such as volume, surface area, sphericity, PC ratio of cell axis, Radius of gyration, volume fraction, orientation analysis, and cre-labeled lineage clusters properties. In one of the observations, we found that in the resting zone of GP the chondrocyte cell grows isometric, while in the proliferative zone, they grow allometric. In other observation, we found that the cell lineage cluster grows circumferential in embryonic mice, while neonatal mice grow in the longitudinal direction.

Prior to above, I used gene expression as a proxy for the effective temperature to explain the chromosome positioning in the nuclei. I developed a biophysical model to predict the chromosomes distributions in the nuclei, and their 2d/3d shapes. The details of this you can read it here:
