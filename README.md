### Hi there 👋

I’m currently working on a machine learning-based pipeline to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing data and image-based spatial transcriptomics data. With this data integration, we learned how the cell type-cell type interaction formed in the niche and how gene covariation occurs between interacted cell types. We have applied this method to the publically available liver, organogenesis, brain, and intestine data. This method could be beneficial for the community to find a novel therapeutic drug target candidate.
