### Hello there! 👋

I’m Ankit, a researcher with a diverse background in computational biology, quantitative modeling, machine learning, and data analysis. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

👉 🧪 Current Role
At CatalYm, I focus on the intersection of spatial omics, and immuno-oncology to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive therapeutic resistance and immune evasion in the TME. My work integrates running different spatial-omics tools to accelerate discovery and guide translational decisions.


👉 🧬 Previous work (2021-2025) @ University of Würzburg, Germany 
I developed NiCo, a computational pipeline that integrates scRNA-seq with image-based spatial transcriptomics to reveal cell-cell communication and gene program (meta-program) covariation within tissue niches. We applied NiCo to diverse biological contexts including liver, brain, and developmental tissues to uncover novel mechanistic insights.

👉 🦴 Past Endeavors (2018-2020) @ Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel

I explored the fascinating realm of bone growth morphogenesis. Using quantitative modeling, statistical analyses, and morphometric techniques applied to growth plate tissue images, we uncovered mechanism governing long bone elongation. Some highlights are: Cell/Nuclei segmentation and registration of bones, Identification of isometric growth of chondrocytes in the resting zone vs. allometric growth in the proliferative zone. Discovery of distinct cell lineage cluster patterns between embryonic and neonatal mice bones contributing to growth directionality

👉 🔬 Research Highlights (2013-2018) @ The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India 

Earlier in my research career, I worked at the intersection of molecular biology, genomics, and computational modeling. Key projects included:

- Chromosome Positioning & Nuclear Architecture
  Developed biophysical models to predict chromatin distribution and chromosome positioning along the radial nuclear axis using gene expression data as a proxy. Explored 2D/3D chromosome structures to understand spatial organization within nuclei.

- Gene Regulation & ChIP-seq Analysis
  Analyzed ChIP-seq datasets to identify motif mixtures using clustering based on sequence similarity and position-based features, helping to characterize regulatory element patterns.

These foundational projects strengthened my skills in statistical modeling, data integration, and the use of genomic signals to inform structural and regulatory insights in cellular systems.
